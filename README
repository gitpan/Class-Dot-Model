NAME
    Class::Dot::Model - Simple way of defining models for DBIx::Class.

VERSION
    This document describes Class::Dot::Model version v%%VERSION%%

SYNOPSIS
         package My::Model;
         use Class::Dot::Model   domain => 'org.mydomain.myapp';
 
         package My::Model::Cat;
         use Class::Dot::Model::Table qw(:has_many);
 
         Table       'cats';
         Columns     qw( id gender dna action colour );
         Primary_Key 'id';
         Has_Many    'memories'
             => 'My::Model::Cat::Memory';
 
         package My::Model::Cat::Memory;
         use Class::Dot::Model::Table qw(:belongs_to);
 
         Table       'memory';
         Columns     qw( id cat content );
         Primary_Key 'id';
         Belongs_To  'cat'
             => 'My::Model::Cat';

    Then you would have to initialize the database configuration for
    org.mydomain.myapp:

         use Config::PlConfig;
         my $DOMAIN   = 'org.mydomain.myapp';
 
         my $dbconfig = {
             driver      => 'mysql',
             database    => 'myappdb',
             hostname    => 'localhost',
             username    => 'me',
             password    => 'secret',
         };
 
         my $plconfig = Config::PlConfig->new({
             domain  => $DOMAIN,
         });
         my $config = $plconfig->load();
         $config->{database} = $dbconfig;
         $plconfig->save();

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     # No user servicable parts inside...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

No user serviceable parts inside.

=head1 SUBROUTINESE<sol>METHODS

=head2 SUBROUTINES

=head3 C<<< install_coderef($coderef => $into_class, $method_name) >>>

Install subroutine into a class with custom name.

Example:

     use Class::Dot::Model qw(install_coderef);
     install_coderef(sub { print "hello world" }, "Hello::World", "hello");
 
     # prints: "hello world".
     Hello::World->hello();

=head3 C<<< push_base_class($the_class, $class_target) >>>

Push a base class into a target class.

Example:

     push_base_class('DBIx::Class',  'MyApp::Model');

Is the same as:

     push @MyApp::Model::ISA, 'DBIx::Class';
 
     {
         package MyApp::Model;
         DBIx::Class->import();
     }

=head3 C<<< run_as_call_class(($callclass, $method, @arguments) | %options_ref) >>>

Run a method in a class, but make it look like another class runs it.

Example:

     package Simpsons::Homer;
 
     sub doh {
         my $caller = caller 0;
         print "$caller: Doh!\n";
     }
 
     run_as_call_class({
         callclass => 'Hello::World',    - the class to take we're in.
         class     => 'Simpsons::Homer',  - the class that has the method to call.
         method    => 'hello'            - the method to call.
     });

Gives the output:

     Hello::World: Doh!

Because it's basicly the same as writing:

     package Simpsons::Homer;
 
     sub doh {
         my $caller = caller 0;
         print "$caller: Doh!\n";
     }
 
     package Hello::World;
     Simpsons::Homer->doh();
 
     package Simpsons::Homer;
 
     # resume other work.

There is also a shortcut method of calling this function if you want to run a
method in the callclass itself:

     package Hello::World;
     run_as_callclass('Simpsons::Homer', 'doh');

Gives the output:

     Simpsons::Homer: Doh!

=head3 C<<< FQDN(@class_components) >>>

Return a valid Perl class name out of a list of class components.

Example:

     FQDN('Class', 'Plugin', 'Util')

Becomes

     Class::Plugin::Util
